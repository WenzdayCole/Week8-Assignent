Saturday: So I forgot to keep a running record on Friday. So far I have been able to set up and connect two tables in Supabase and render the main posts. Making the static routes was simple enough and I'm console  logging the posts in dynamic routes. I had some problems trying to do that while following Manny's code and adapting it to my db collumns but I figured that out.

Sunday: Currently trying to figure out how to have a comments form render on the page below the actual post. However it's not working yet, and tbh I don't think it will by the time I have to submit.(Never mind, James Adams fixed it) The way you can navigate to the posts is in the url /post/1, 2 etc.

I haven't been able to make an option to sort them into asc or dec order. And I haven't even tried to make a delete button. 

Feed back:
Can you tell me why my  form for the comments page has to be in the div tag?
Does this affect styling? - Although I guess I could style it in the component file. But then wouldn't the styling on the posts overide it when I put in the div?
How do I make it work outside the div?
And a big question I couldn't figure out, how do I turn the posts on the homepage into links to take the user to the dynamic route?
