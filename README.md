Saturday: So I forgot to keep a running record on Friday. So far I have been able to set up and connect to tables in Supabase and render the main posts. Making the static routes was simple enough and I'm console  logging the posts in dynamic routes. I had some problems trying to do that while following Manny's code and adapting it to my db collumns but I figured that out.
